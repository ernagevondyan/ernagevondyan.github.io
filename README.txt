Welcome to building your website!

Here is an example htdocs folder that you can put into your XAMPP installation and run. If you would like, you can even just modify the contents of this directory to build your website.

This website will teach you how to use the basic structural elements of XHTML to build a functioning website. You must master this before you begin styling your site to make it aesthetically pleasing.

Remember: HTML is used to structure a document, while CSS is used to style and position items within the document. While it's tempting to do so when you are first learning, don't use HTML tags to style the document.

To start, put this htdocs file in your XAMPP installation and start Apache. Alternatively, if you are working without an XAMPP installation, you can open the index.html file in this directory with your browser.
